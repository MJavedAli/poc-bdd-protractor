## File Naming Conventions

File naming should use a combination Dot Case and camel case naming convention. Avoid using any other naming conventions to keep the file structure across all projects consistent.

#### dot case example:

> login.functions.ts

#### DotCase with Camel Case Example:

The combination Dot Case/Camel Case comes into play when the name of the component is longer than a single word.

> downloadWsdl.steps.ts

#### Page Object pattern related conventions:

> All page object files should end with '.page.ts'

> All step function files should end with '.functions.ts'

> All step definitions should end with '.steps.ts'
