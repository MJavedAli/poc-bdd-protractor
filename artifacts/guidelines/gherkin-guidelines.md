## Gherkin Guidelines

- Limit one feature per feature file. This makes it easy to find features.
- Limit the number of scenarios per feature. Nobody wants a thousand-line feature file. A good measure is a dozen scenarios per feature.
- Limit the number of steps per scenario to less than ten.
- Limit the character length of each step. Common limits are 100-120 characters.
- Use proper spelling.
- Use proper grammar.
- Capitalize Gherkin keywords.
- Capitalize the first word in titles.
- Do not capitalize words in the step phrases unless they are proper nouns.
- Do not use punctuation (specifically periods and commas) at the end of step phrases.
- Use single spaces between words.
- Indent the content beneath every section header.
- Separate features and scenarios by two blank lines.
- Separate examples tables by 1 blank line.
- Do not separate steps within a scenario by blank lines.
- Space table delimiter pipes (“|”) evenly.
- Adopt a standard set of tag names. Avoid duplicates.
- Write all tag names in lowercase, and use hyphens (“-“) to separate words.
- Limit the length of tag names.
